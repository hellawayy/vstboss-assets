Soothe2 is a dynamic resonance suppressor. It identifies problematic resonances on the fly and applies matching reduction automatically. 
This results in a smoother, more balanced sound and saves you from having to notch out frequencies by hand. 
The reduction only kicks in when and where needed, without affecting nearby frequency areas. 
This preserves the timbre of the original sound source resulting in a transparent treatment with minimal artifacts.
